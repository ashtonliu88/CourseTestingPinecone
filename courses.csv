Poor conditions?like overcrowding, lack of sanitation, and inadequate heating or cooling?can contribute to respiratory problems, infections, and chronic health conditions. Housing located near agricultural fields can increase exposure to pesticides, which can have both immediate and long-term health effects. And the lack of security associated with temporary living situations can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. This course provides an interdisciplinary exploration of the critical issues surrounding seasonal farmworker housing and health in California. Through a combination of research and community engagement, students will analyze the current state of farmworker housing in California, its relationship to health outcomes, and investigate current housing policies and assess their effectiveness in addressing the needs of farmworkers. Guest speakers from agriculture, public health, and policy-making will offer firsthand insights into the complexities of addressing the issue. Students will collaborate on a capstone project that emphasizes critical thinking, cultural humility, and community-based research to not only analyze existing housing challenges but also to propose innovative solutions for improving housing conditions and health outcomes for migrant/seasonal farmworkers.","Days & Times: TuTh 01:30PM-03:05PM, Room: J Baskin Engr 372, Instructor: Bugg,L., Dates: 01/06/25 - 03/14/25",

Defined as it was by the fact of the Soviet Union (1922-1991) and the presence of socialist politics in various locations of a decolonizing world, the last century gave rise to artistic experiments in new media to further articulate and inspire a revolutionary subjectivity. What was this subjectivity and how did it come into being? How did it see and transform the objective environment? What were its parameters, zones of influence, gender, race, or sexual politics? How did it understand the individual, traditional communities, and emergent masses, and what were the relations between these various scales of historical experience? This course argues that only a wide global approach to cinematic culture can suffice to answer these questions. Films from the USSR, Mexico, Algeria, Argentina, Italy, India, Germany, Cuba, Senegal, and Turkey will be screened and students will learn about the aesthetic forms that defined revolutionary art in this period.

Critical approach designations: Geographies, Media. Distribution requirement: Global.",,"Course Topic: Satyajit Ray and the Cinema of Modernity - Satyajit Ray has been hailed as one of the greatest film directors of the twentieth century and a major exponent of cinematic modernism in India. Yet it is only in recent times that his work has begun to receive critical attention in film theory and criticism. We will take cues from this scholarship and explore the question of modernity as seen through Ray?s cinematic lens. Attention will be given to the historical genesis of modern tensions and conflicts that Ray engaged with, including the deepening divides between colonialism and nationalism, casteism and humanism, the country and the city, superstition and medical science, and traditional masculinity and the assertion of feminism. We will have opportunity to explore the literary, musical, theatrical and general cultural background of Ray?s films, exploring especially the translation of literary texts into the cinematic medium. Students will also be required to gain familiarity with the concepts and vocabulary of film and media studies, as well as relevant facets of the intellectual history of modern India.","Days & Times: TuTh 09:50AM-11:25AM, Room: Earth&Marine B210, Instructor: Sahota,G.S., Dates: 01/06/25 - 03/14/25",

Beginning with these general questions, this course surveys the work of some of the outstanding classic and contemporary Jewish comic writers: from the Yiddish comic tradition pioneered by Sholem Aleichem through successive generations of Jewish satirists, working in multiple genres (novels, short stories, memoirs, sketch comedies, cartoons, films, television series) during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.
