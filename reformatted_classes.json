Invention, creative problem-solving, and the articulation of these visual ideas will also be explored. Students will strengthen their use of traditional perceptual and conceptual painting skills from a range of subjects and approaches including the figure and abstraction, while forging into more experimental directions such as laser cut stencils and material explorations such as charcoal preparation.",

Introduces undergraduates to the emerging field of chemical biology. There is no laboratory guide with pre-designed experiments and results; instead, students develop a hypothesis and work toward understanding a novel system at the interface of multiple biological and chemical subdisciplines. Students gain technical skills related to these areas by designing experiments, researching primary literature, using public databases, and applying various software programs to aid in data analysis and interpretation.

Guided by instructors, they deepen their understanding of Flutter and apply their knowledge in a final project where they create their own mobile app. This experience not only strengthens technical skills but also fosters teamwork and problem-solving, supporting learners to confidently enter the tech industry with a practical, impactful skill set. No previous experience required.",

Course considers how gender and sexuality are systems of rules often assumed in game design, and how those rules can be subverted to create novel and experimental games. By identifying and resisting cisnormativity and heteronormativity, students create original game concepts, using a critical, intersectional approach that understands that race as a constitutive element of both gender and sexuality. Course also studies with queer and trans ecologies understanding gender and race as inseparable from our idea of nature.",

Weekly assignments mean working outside of class on steps or skills for co-creating and fundraising with partners and then sharing work for peer-review in class in the next week. Expect to do the reading and weekly assignments before each week's seminar session. Instructor provides separate instructions for weekly assignments.",

By focusing specifically on the land-grant college system, we will examine the institutionalization of scientific agriculture as a key analytic for understanding settler colonial dispossession and racialization in the second half of the nineteenth century.

        "description": "What would we learn about the pressing questions of our time if we centered sound, noise, voice, and music? To think with sound or to think sonically ''is to think conjuncturally about sound and culture.'' Such a ''sonic imagination,'' not only enables us to immerse ourselves in the questions and problems of our time but has the potential to ''redescribe them from unexpected standpoints.'' Thinking with a feminist and sonic imagination, this course is interested in exploring conjunctures and culture by using sound as its point of departure. It serves as an immersive introduction to sound studies and as a senior seminar encourages students to center soundscapes in their own research.",

Poor conditions?like overcrowding, lack of sanitation, and inadequate heating or cooling?can contribute to respiratory problems, infections, and chronic health conditions. Housing located near agricultural fields can increase exposure to pesticides, which can have both immediate and long-term health effects. And the lack of security associated with temporary living situations can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. This course provides an interdisciplinary exploration of the critical issues surrounding seasonal farmworker housing and health in California. Through a combination of research and community engagement, students will analyze the current state of farmworker housing in California, its relationship to health outcomes, and investigate current housing policies and assess their effectiveness in addressing the needs of farmworkers. Guest speakers from agriculture, public health, and policy-making will offer firsthand insights into the complexities of addressing the issue. Students will collaborate on a capstone project that emphasizes critical thinking, cultural humility, and community-based research to not only analyze existing housing challenges but also to propose innovative solutions for improving housing conditions and health outcomes for migrant/seasonal farmworkers.",

This seminar explores relationships between ocean ecosystems and global and community health. Understanding connections between ocean ecosystems and human health is critical for developing effective policies and taking action to safeguard both marine environments and human well-being. Students will examine key topics such as sea level change, plastic pollution, biodiversity loss, marine toxins, saltwater intrusion, seafood safety, and water-borne infectious diseases. Through guest speakers and community-engaged research and writing, students will apply critical thinking skills and generate strategies to inform efforts in ocean regeneration and sustainability as related to global and community health. With this greater understanding, we can advocate for environmental justice and ocean stewardship, as well as protect planetary health for the future.",

And how can we build better navigation tools and advising services to support such students as they make their way from high schools to community college to universities? These are some of the pressing questions that we will take up in this Task Force. We will build on and contribute to ongoing work in the Central Coast region to provide better integrated health workforce education opportunities.

It?s channeled through global capitalism. It inspires and reflects resistance to the status-quo even as what?s new quickly becomes old. This class consider multiple moments in fashion history from ancient Egypt to the French Revolution and postcolonial Africa to 1980s punk to 21 st century genderqueer style to the recent election, and many more. Visually centered lectures incorporate images and videos. Brief readings from social theory, feminist, trans, and queer studies, critical race studies, literary theory, visual studies, and sustainability-focused designers help students think and write critically about fashion. Creative options for other work include making a zine, video, or podcast; planning a class runway show; curating a lookbook; and more.

This course explores some questions that arise when we turn the lens on translators and acts of translation.

What philosophical questions does translation raise? How are our worlds limited or expanded by what gets translated into the language(s) we speak? Why do literary ?classics? get re-translated every generation or so? How have translation movements shaped the development of cultures and civilizations? What does it mean to translate the word of God or other sacred writings from one language to another? What political ramifications do translators face? How are distinctive dialects, registers, and other cultural features preserved or lost in translation? <<<<<< ***** If you have satisfied the language prerequisite through coursework or through a language exam and are experiencing challenges with enrollment please reach out to the Literature Department ( litdept@ucsc.edu ) for help enrolling in the course.

Finally, we will want to contextualize all of this, not so much into a reconstruction of Kafka?s biography, but of the figure of Kafka (as a Jewish writer producing texts in German in fin de siecle Prague) and of his work as a site where identity, genre, language, and social life are called into question in complex and often contradictory ways.

Defined as it was by the fact of the Soviet Union (1922-1991) and the presence of socialist politics in various locations of a decolonizing world, the last century gave rise to artistic experiments in new media to further articulate and inspire a revolutionary subjectivity. What was this subjectivity and how did it come into being? How did it see and transform the objective environment? What were its parameters, zones of influence, gender, race, or sexual politics? How did it understand the individual, traditional communities, and emergent masses, and what were the relations between these various scales of historical experience? This course argues that only a wide global approach to cinematic culture can suffice to answer these questions. Films from the USSR, Mexico, Algeria, Argentina, Italy, India, Germany, Cuba, Senegal, and Turkey will be screened and students will learn about the aesthetic forms that defined revolutionary art in this period. Readings will combine history, philosophy, fiction, and theory.",

We will take cues from this scholarship and explore the question of modernity as seen through Ray?s cinematic lens. Attention will be given to the historical genesis of modern tensions and conflicts that Ray engaged with, including the deepening divides between colonialism and nationalism, casteism and humanism, the country and the city, superstition and medical science, and traditional masculinity and the assertion of feminism. We will have opportunity to explore the literary, musical, theatrical and general cultural background of Ray?s films, exploring especially the translation of literary texts into the cinematic medium.

Why do the words Jewish comedy roll trippingly off the tongue, like French cuisine or Scottish terrier? Why did Jews rely so much on comedy, humor, and wit in negotiating their transition to modernity? Which aspects of Jewish culture and experience have Jewish writers and artists drawn upon in creating their distinctive brands of comedy? Is there a single shared Jewish comic sensibility, or have there been several? Beginning with these general questions, this course surveys the work of some of the outstanding classic and contemporary Jewish comic writers: from the Yiddish comic tradition pioneered by Sholem Aleichem through successive generations of Jewish satirists, working in multiple genres (novels, short stories, memoirs, sketch comedies, cartoons, films, television series) during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Among them: Sholem Aleichem, Franz Kafka, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Bruno Schulz, Nora Ephron, Gary Shteyngart, Saul Steinberg, William Steig, Jules Feiffer, Roz Chast, Philip Roth, Mel Brooks, Etgar Keret, Ethan and Joel Cohen, Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson.",

Compromise, for example, can be experienced or interpreted as personal sacrifice rather than fertile ground for possibility. Solving many of the world's most significant issues (climate change, economic instability, pandemic, etc.) will require collective effort and this will challenge us to create new ways of being and thinking. Through classroom discussions, journal reflections, and experiential exercises, students investigate models of collaboration, how social inequities can challenge collaborative work, the importance of common purpose, practices that support respectful and inclusive deliberation, and student organizations as sites of collaboration.
